# PathFinder

Note - this program was designed to be run from an Ubuntu command line. 
The code can be run by writing a command line prompt such as "main.py 'xxxx/xxxx/xxx'", which the x's representing the directory you have downloaded the
program to. 

A path-finder that uses an A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from A to B given a set of restrictions. Given a file input with a set of X and Y
coordinates where the first and last coordinates are the start and end points and the intervening coordinates represent 'reefs' the path cannot go through,
this program will produce an output file showing the correct path.
